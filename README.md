# JavaScript and Node.js

Although JavaScript is a general-purpose programming language, we use it primarily in web projects (front-end, back-end, or even both). In this learning project, we will discover JavaScript and Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment (i.e., we use it to execute our JavaScript codes).

First, we start with the [preliminaries](#preliminaries) section to prepare the development environment. After that, if you are new to programming and JavaScript, shake yourself in the [Javascript introduction](#javascript-introduction) section; skip it otherwise. Finally, look at the [Node.js a bit more](#nodejs-a-bit-more) part for some essential topics, such as debugging and testing.

## Preliminaries

Before playing with JavaScript, we need to install [Node.js](install.md) and [Visual Studio Code](visual-studio-code.md#installation), a powerful and free code editor. Then try to [compose a first script](visual-studio-code.md#start-coding) and [execute it](run-scripts.md).

- [Install Node.js guide](install.md)
- [Install Visual Studio Code guide](visual-studio-code.md#installation)
- [Start coding in Visual Studio Code](visual-studio-code.md#start-coding)
- [Run a script](run-scripts.md)

## JavaScript introduction

- [Variable](variable.md)
- [Function](function.md)
- [Data type](data-type.md)
- [Module](module.md)
- [Scope](scope.md)
- [Loop](loop.md)
- [Running flow](run-flow.md)

## Node.js a bit more

- [Debugging](debug.md)
- [Packages and npm](npm.md)
- [Testing](test.md)
