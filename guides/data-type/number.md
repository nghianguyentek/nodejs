# `number`

The `number` primitive data type represents all numeric data, including floating-point (having a decimal point) numbers. In JavaScript, there are two implicit subtypes of `number`: ***integer*** and ***float***. 

For example, `1` and `-1` are integers, and `1.0` and `-1.1` are floats. In source code files, `1` and  `-1` are integer literals. Likewise, `1.0` and `-1.1` are float literals. All of them are number literals.

## Operations on `number` values

JavaScript supports the following operations for the `number` data type:

- [Arithmetic operations](#arithmetic-operations)
- [Comparision operations](#comparision-operations)

### Arithmetic operations

|Operator|Description   |Examples|
|:------:|:------------:|:------:|
| +      |Addition      |`1 + 2` |
| -      |Subtraction   |`2 - 1` |
| *      |Multiplication|`2 * 1` |
| /      |Division      |`2 / 1` |
| %      |Remainder     |`1 % 2` |

### Comparision operations

|Operator|Description           |Examples |
|:------:|:--------------------:|:-------:|
| ===    |Equals                |`1 === 2`|
| !==    |Not equal             |`2 !== 1`|
| >      |Greater than          |`2 > 1`  |
| >==    |Greater than or equals|`2 / 1`  |
| <      |Less than             |`1 < 2`  |
| <==    |Less than or equals   |`1 <= 2` |
