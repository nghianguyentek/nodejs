# Node.js Installation Guide

Since there are many Node.js versions, it's up to you to choose the latest LTS (Long Term Support) or an older version. Due to the restriction of Node.js support of my web hosting, I prefer to install the `v14.17.3` version. If your laptop runs on Windows OS (Operating System), read the [on Windows](#on-windows) section.

## On Windows

1. Download or open [node-v14.17.3-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.17.3/node-v14.17.3-x64.msi).
2. Follow the steps of the installer to complete the setup.
