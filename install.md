# Node.js Installation

It depends on which version you want to run your product. As a result, due to the restriction of Node.js support of our hosting, we need to install the `v14.17.3` version. If you installed another version, please uninstall and reinstall to the `v14.17.3` version.

## On Windows x64

1. Download or open [node-v14.17.3-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.17.3/node-v14.17.3-x64.msi)
2. Open Terminal, type `node -v` to verify your installation
