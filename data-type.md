# Data types in Node.js

A data type is a named group of data characteristics; for example, numbers and sequences of characters (i.e., strings).
In JavaScript, we have two data type groups: simple (primitive) and complex (object).

## Common primitive types

The characteristic of primitive types is immutable. That is, we can not change the value after creating. Common
primitive types in JavaScript are:

- [number](#number-type) 
- [string](#string-type) 
- [boolean](#boolean-type)
- [undefined](#undefined-type)
- [null](#null-type)

### Number type

All numeric data, including floating-point (having a decimal point) numbers.

### String type

Sequence of characters

### Boolean type

Logical value, either `true` or `false`

### undefined type

`undefined`, indicates no value is specified

### null type

`null`, indicates no object is specified

## Complex types

A complex type is a combination of others. Common JavaScript built-in types are `object` and `function`. Note
that `function` is an `object` type having the callable characteristic, and whenever we create a [function](function.md)
, we create a new `object` type. Non built-in types are called user-defined (or custom) types.
