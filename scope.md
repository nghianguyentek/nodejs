# Scopes in JavaScript

Every identifier (variable, function, etc.) has a scope where we can use them after declaration. In JavaScript, we have:

- [Global scope](#global-scope)
- [Module scope](#module-scope)
- [Block scope](#block-scope)

## Global scope

If an identifier has global scope, we can use it everywhere.

## Module scope

If an identifier has module scope, we can use it everywhere in the module where it was declared.

## Block scope

If an identifier was declared in a code block (code between a bracket parentheses `{}`), we can use it everywhere in the block and its inner blocks.
