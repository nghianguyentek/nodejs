# Primitive Data Types

***Primitive types*** are ***simple types*** have ***no base type***, such as numbers and texts. In JavaScript, primitive `number` and `string` represent numbers and texts, respectively. Besides that, JavaScript primitive types have `undefined`, `boolean`, `null`, and `bigint` more. In this section, we, however, only discover `boolean`, `number`, `string`, and `undefined`. We will cover the `null` in the [complex data types]() part. About the `bigint` type, since we use them only for representing bigger numbers than the `number` type, I leave it as a research assignment.

- [`number`](number.md)
- [`string`](string.md)
- [`undefined`](undefined.md)
